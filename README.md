# Monorepo Portfolio build

The goal of this project was to test my hands on different frontend technologies.
I also went with a monorepo architecture to get the basics about how to set one up.
This project features three different codebase,

-   Astro
-   Svelte
-   React

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RehkMansa/portfolio-monorepo.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd portfolio-monorepo
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  yarn # the project uses yarn workspace to manage the monorepo
```

Start the server

```bash
  yarn start:astro #starts astro project @port 3006
```

### Additional Notes

This project is yet to be finished, as of now, only the astro project is available, Subsequently other libraries will be added
